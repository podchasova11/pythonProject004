Python Interview Preparation
1. Explain 'Everything in Python is an object'.
What's an object? An object in a object-oriented programming language is an entity that contains data along with some methods for operations related to that data.
Everything from numbers, lists, strings, functions and classes are python objects.

>>> a = 10.5
>>> a.is_integer() # Float type has is_integer() method cause a is an object of float class
False
>>> type(a)
<class 'float'>
>>> def func()
....    pass
>>> type(func)
<class 'function'>
>>> # like functions, classes are also objects of 'type' class
Look at the below example

>>> var = 'Tom' # Object 'Tom' is created in memory and name 'var' is binded to it. 
>>> var = 'Harry' # Another object is created however note that name 'var' is now binded to 'Harry' but 'Tom' is still somewhere in memory and is unaffected.

2. What is mutable and immutable objects/data types in Python?
Mutation generally refers to 'change'. So when we say that an object is mutable or immutable we meant to say that the value of object can/cannot change.
When an object is created in Python, it is assigned a type and an id. An object/data type is mutable if with the same id, the value of the object changes after the object is created.

Mutable objects in Python -- Objects that can change after creation. Lists, byte arrays, sets, and dictionaries.

>>> list_var = [17, 10]
>>> list_var
[17, 10]
>>> id(list_var)
2289772854208
>>> list_var += [17]
>>> list_var
[17, 10, 17]
>>> id(list_var) # ID of the object didn't change.
2289772854208
Immutable objects in Python -- Numeric data types, strings, bytes, frozen sets, and tuples.

>>> # Example of tuples
>>> tuple_var = (17,)
>>> tuple_var
(17,)
>>> id(tuple_var)
1753146091504
>>> tuple_var += (10,)
>>> tuple_var
(17,10)
>>> id(tuple_var) # ID changes when made changes in object.
1753153466880
Mutable objects and functon arguments

def sample_func(sample_arg):
    sample_agr.append(10)
    # No need to return the obj since it is utilizing the same memory block

sample_list = [7, 8, 9]
sample_func(sample_list)
print(sample_list) # [7, 8, 9, 10]
3. What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
Parameter	List	Tuples
Syntax	Square brackets or list keyword	Round brackets/parenthesis or tuple keyword
Nature	Mutable	Immutable
Item Assignment	Possible	Not Possible
Reusablity	Copied	Not Copied
Performance	Relatively slower	Relatively faster
Memory	Large-Extra than the element size	Fixed to element size
Note: It is not required for tuples to have parenthesis, one can also define tuple python a = 2, 3, 4 

Memory Allocation of Tuple and List
Tuple does not allot any extra memory during construction because it will be immutable so does not have to worry about addition of elements.

>>> tuple_var = tuple()
>>> tuple_var.__sizeof__() # take 24 bytes for empty tuple
24
>>> tuple_var = (1,2) # additional 8 bytes for each integer element
>>> tuple_var.__sizeof__()
40
List over-allocates memory otherwise list.append would be an O(n) operation.

>>> list_var = list()
>>> list_var.__sizeof__() # take 40 bytes for empty list
40
>>> list_var.append(1)
>>> list_var.__sizeof__() # append operation allots extra memory size considering future appends
72
>>> list_var
[1]
>>> list_var.append(2)
>>> list_var.__sizeof__() # size remains same since list has space available
72
>>> list_var
[1,2]
Reusablity
Tuple literally assigns the same object to the new variable while list basically copies all the elements of the existing list.

>>> # List vs Tuples | Reused vs. Copied
>>> old_list = [1,2]
>>> old_list.append(3)
>>> old_list
[1, 2, 3]
>>> id(old_list) 
2594206915456
>>> old_list.__sizeof__()
88

>>> # Copying list
>>> new_list = list(old_list)
>>> new_list
[1, 2, 3]
>>> id(new_list) # new id so new list is created
2594207110976
>>> new_list.__sizeof__() # size is also not same as old_list
64

>>> Tuple Copy
>>> old_tuple = (1,2)
>>> id(old_tuple)
2594206778048
>>> old_tuple.__sizeof__()
40
>>> new_tuple = tuple(old_tuple)
>>> id(new_tuple) # same id as old_tuple
2594206778048
>>> new_tuple.__sizeof__() # also same size as old_tuple since it is refering to old_
