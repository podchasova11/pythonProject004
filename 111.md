### Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) 
is a command shell for UNIX-like operating systems (UNIX, GNU/Linux, MacOS). It gives the user a system of commands for working with files and folders, searching, setting up the environment and allows you to control the OS directly from the command line.

## What does bash do? 
The shell takes commands that the user has entered on the command line and interprets them, that is, translates them into machine code. The operating system receives code as instructions and executes them. There is another way to use it: creating bash or shell scripts that are saved in a file. Each time the file is run, the set of commands specified in it will be executed.

## Why to use bash? 
The same actions with files, folders and search can be performed using the OS GUI. But it is longer, more inconvenient and more difficult. Programmers use bash or shell to make working with the system easier and faster. For example, to copy a file using the graphical interface, you need to open the folder where it is located, right-click on the file, call the context menu and select "Copy". And if you use the command line and bash, you will need to enter one command.

## How to run bash? 
The interpreter shell is built into the operating system and is enabled automatically. Just open a terminal window and start typing commands.

## What is SSH? 
One of the most important tools in the work of a system administrator is SSH. SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol used to securely log in to remote systems. This is the most common way to access remote Linux servers.

## How does SSH work? 
SSH connects the client program to the ssh server named sshd. The sshd server must be running on your server. If this is not the case, you may need to connect to the server through the web console or local serial console. Signing in via SSH using keys. While it can be useful to be able to log in to a remote system with passwords, it's a much better idea to set up authentication with keys.
